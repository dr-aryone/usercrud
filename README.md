# usercrud
Just a generic CRUD app with authentication to act as a boiler for future MEAN stack projects

Okay, this is pretty simple. Clone, run npm install and bower install, then run npm server.js in one terminal tab and grunt serve in another. This will start the server and open the app up in your browser.

This isn't the next big app or a cool new library. It's just a boilerplate of code that I wrote for myself, to make it way easier to start a MEAN stack project that requires some basic things: persistance layer, user registration, and tools for quick front end prototyping. Take a copy and edit at your pleasure.
